    <p style="font-size:20px" class="paragraph"><b>This is the second game that I created in Construct 3. The name of the game is called "Falling Spike Game". It's a game where you play as a block and you have to dodge the spikes, if you are able to dodge the spikes your score increases until you get hit by one of the spikes. There are also mystery boxes that can give you powerups or do nothing, those powerups can be good and make you last longer but some are bad which may make you lose.</b></p>

<h3><u>Description:</u></h3><p style="background-color:PowderBlue;" class="paragraph">The point of the game is that you are playing as a block named, Mr. Block and he is trying to not to get hit by the falling spikes.</p>
    
<h3><u>Controls:</u></h3><p style="background-color:PowderBlue;" class="paragraph">If you want to move Mr. Block, you have to use the mouse if you are on a computer or tap on the screen if you are on a mobile device. </p>
